          Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Jared and I am an amateur
          writer, photopher, and programmer who enjoys reading and speding time
          in the forest. Here, I will post stories and articles I've written, as
          well as photography and my reading list. If you have any questions or
          would like to reach out to me, please contact me via my
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaredreadsandruns" target="blank"
            >Instagram</a
          >. I have made this site very simple, but it does use JavaScript in
          the navigation to my
          <a href="./pages/fiction/fiction.html">Fiction</a>,
          <a href="./pages/articles/articles.html">Articles</a>,
          <a href="./pages/photography/photography.html">Photography</a>, and
          <a href="./pages/reading-list/reading-list.html">Reading List</a>
          pages. If You have disabled JavaScript in your browser, please use the
          links in the previous sentence for navigation. Please note that this
          site uses Amazon affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate I earn from
          qualifying purchases. These links will only be to books/media that I
          have personally read or own, and are not based on sketchy advertising,
          nor will I actively push someone to purchase an item through said
          links. I will try to link to the exact version of a book that I have
          read, whether that be a physical copy, ebook, or audio book. If you
          have any questions or concerns, please reach out via my
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaredreadsandruns" target="blank"
            >Instagram</a
          >. Note further, not all links are affiliate links. Some links are to
          other sites and I may update this blog at some point to put multiple
          links on an individual item: for instance, I may add an Amazon link
          alongside a Project Gutenburg link for the same book. I would
          recommend that if you are interested in a book mentioned on this site
          that you check if your local library or bookstore has it before
          purchasing a copy online.
