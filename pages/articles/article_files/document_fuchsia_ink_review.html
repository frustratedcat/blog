                <p class="fiction-article-description">I purchased <span class="article-document-fuchsia">Document Fuchsia</span> from <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/de-atramentis-document-fuchsia-ink-sample?_pos=2&_psq=document+f&_ss=e&_v=1.0" target="blank" alt="Link to Goulet Pen Company Site">The Goulet Pen Company</a>, and used it during November and December 2024 with a <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/twsbi-eco-fountain-pen-dark-sapphire" target="blank" alt="Link to TWSBI ECO fountain pen">TWSBI ECO Fountain Pen - Dark Sapphire</a>. The ink is a nice, bright fuchsia that I did not experience any smearing despite its smoothness. The ink lasted approximately #### words for daily journaling and fiction writing sessions, and was quite enjoyable. The color is a bit too bright for my taste as I like darker colors, but as that is only a personal preference I will not hold anything against hte ink as color choice is only a preference. As for De Atramentis, I have to say they made a good ink that writes quite well. In the future I would like to try out some of their darker inks. For those who like fuchsia I would absolutely recommend this ink as it writes well and looks good.</p>
