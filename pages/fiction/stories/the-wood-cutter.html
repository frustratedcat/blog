        The dimming sunlight left the forest hidden in darkness as the sound of
        an ax splitting logs echoed throughout the ravine. The boy and his
        father worked tirelessly to bring in as much firewood as they could for
        the coming winter. Besides them, the forest was silent throughout.
        Calling out to the boy, the man began loading the wagon to head home for
        the night. The boy motioned for the man to head out without him so he
        could finish the last few logs and the man went on, leaving the boy to
        his work. Silence was what the boy craved, and the forest was the only
        place that silence existed, where he could be alone with his thoughts.
        Just he and his ax, his books and paper and pen hidden neatly in his
        bag. He listened to the echo of the ax reverberate throughout the forest
        as it wedged through log after log, making its way into the soil
        beneath. O! How poplar sounded as it gave way to the great heft of sharp
        steel. Rearing his ax and striking again and again was no chore for the
        boy, for the meditative clarity it brought his mind was incomparable.
        After a bit of time the boy finished his work, and, being too dark
        within the trees to pull out a book, took up his sack over his shoulder
        and started toward the edge of the wood. A menagerie of leaves crunched
        beneath his step as his eyes worked to keep him on the narrow path
        consumed by darkness. It was uncommon for the boy to leave the forest so
        late, but arriving behind the day left him little choice as his writing
        had preoccupied him. What an imagination he had! Thinking up stories of
        things unseen, lurking about the forests of his mind. For the boy,
        stories were of revered fascination, nothing compared. His mind wandered
        about stories like a cat slinking through the high grass in search of
        his prey, and how delicious the meal was when he captured it! Stumbling
        on a rock, the boy found he was back to reality where he failed to
        notice he had veered off his path. How long had he been going in the
        dark forest whilst dreaming of stories? Surely he should have reached
        the forest edge by now, but trees surrounded him in the pale moonlight.
        A sudden fear struck the boy, for everyone knows it's no good meandering
        about a forest at night. Snap! The boy froze as the sound of a stick
        breaking in the distance. He stood motionless, listening to the
        deafening silence of a wood occupied by not only he. All was silent with
        the exception of his pounding heart as it sought to remove itself from
        his chest. Leaves crunched and creaked as his feet willed themselves to
        move again, but which way should he go? The boy realized he had
        disoriented himself and did not know the direction from whence he came.
        He moved steadily, gripping his ax tight, his sack resting helplessly on
        his shoulder. Snap! Another stick snapped in the distance but closer
        than the last. The boy looked about frantically in a panicked search for
        the forest edge. In desperation he quenched his fear and kept moving.
        Snap! Snap! It was closer now, but still unseen though his tear-filled
        eyes. In terror, the boy began to run as he struggled to maintain his
        grasp on the ax with his sweaty hands. Snap! Snap! Snap! The sounds were
        all around him now. He let out a petrified shriek as he collided with a
        tree, striking at it with his ax. Pulling his ax from the tree he fell
        to the ground where he lay quivering in the dead Autumn leaves. All was
        silent, not a leaf rustled in the breeze, nothing. He lay there,
        gripping his ax with all his might as his body shook violently in the
        cold night. Seeking to regain some sort of composure, he closed his eyes
        as tight as he could, taking deep breaths. For a moment or so he felt
        calm, as if all of this was merely a product of his immense imagination.
        He was calm, he was, and so he rose to his feet, letting out a deep
        breath as he loosened his grip on the ax. Moving again, he felt himself
        at ease. How one's imagination can play tricks on him, he thought.
        Cautiously, he stepped through the trees, feeling his way as he searched
        the up-sloping earth in hope of leaving the ravine. Although he was
        somewhat embarrassed at himself for such folly in the dark forest, he
        smiled at the story he could tell his friends. What a laugh he'll have
        as they cower at such peril! A low, deep brrring stopped him. Looking
        toward the sound in the trees, he let out a horrified whimper of a
        scream as the branches above crunched and cracked and snapped. Among
        them were two bright yellow eyes in the solemn blackness of the night.
