      <p class="fiction-article-description">
        Included here is a collection of my fiction that I have chosen to post.
        As an amatuer writer, I enjoy writing but do not finish as many stories
        as I would like to. My hope is that this page will grow over time and
        eventually turn into one with links to published works.
