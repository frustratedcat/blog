                  Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Jared and I am an amateur
                  writer, photographer, and programmer who enjoys reading and spending
                  time in the forest. Here, I will post stories and articles I've
                  written, as well as photography and my reading list. If you have any
                  questions or would like to reach out to me, please contact me via my
                  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaredreadsandruns" target="blank"
                    >Instagram</a
                  >. Please note that this site uses Amazon affiliate links. As an
                  Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. These links will
                  only be to books/media that I have personally read or own, and are not
                  based on sketchy advertising, nor will I actively push someone to
                  purchase an item through said links. I will try to link to the exact
                  version of a book that I have read, whether that be a physical copy,
                  ebook, or audio book. If you have any questions or concerns, please
                  reach out via my
                  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaredreadsandruns" target="blank"
                    >Instagram</a
                  >. Note further, not all links are affiliate links. Some links are to
                  other sites and I may update this blog at some point to put multiple
                  links on an individual item: for instance, I may add an Amazon link
                  alongside a
                  <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="blank"
                    >Project Gutenberg</a
                  >
                  link for the same book. I would recommend that if you are interested
                  in a book mentioned on this site that you check if your local library
                  or bookstore has it before purchasing a copy online.
